A "Guess the Number" game in JavaScript is a fun and interactive project where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Here's a concise description of how it works:

Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
User Input: The player inputs their guess through a prompt, form, or input field.
Feedback Mechanism: The program compares the user's guess with the random number and provides feedback:
If the guess is too high, it displays "Too high!"
If the guess is too low, it displays "Too low!"
If the guess is correct, it congratulates the player.
Attempts Limit (Optional): The game may limit the number of attempts (e.g., 10 tries) to increase the challenge.
Replay Option: After the game ends, the player may be given an option to play again.
This game is a great way to practice JavaScript concepts like:

Random number generation (Math.random()),
Conditional statements (if-else),
Loops (for repeated attempts),
Event handling (for interactive input).
Itâ€™s simple to build yet engaging, making it a popular beginner project!
